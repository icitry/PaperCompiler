I hereby bring forth the weapon of choice in the fight against AI â€“ a Paper Compiler, as in a compiler that runs any code using only your handwriting on piece of paper.

Watch as, making use of technologies ranging from OCR (Optical Character Recognition) models, to Code Execution Systems and various brand new, shiny and interesting solutions, I create an app (using Flutter.. ) that allows me to take photos of a piece of code, optionally its input, and get in return the result of the code's execution, formatted using my very own handwriting (in an almost ideal manner - cope).
